## 1. LLM-NodeJS Dataset Description

The **LLM-NodeJS Dataset** is a collection of **50,000 unique Node.js JavaScript code samples** generated by 20 state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs). Each LLM generated 2,500 samples based on prompts that required the creation of complex, realistic Node.js server-side scripts, for example: *"Create an API service that receives uploaded audio files and returns them converted to MP3 using FFmpeg integration."*. Only scripts that successfully passed the `node --check` syntax validation were included in the dataset. 

There are currently three types of datasets available: **LLM-NodeJS Small**, **LLM-NodeJS Medium**, and **LLM-NodeJS Large**.

## Architecture Design

The framework for creating the LLM-NodeJS Dataset is illustrated in the following figure.

The JavaScript samples were transformed into multiple formats to support research in areas such as malware analysis and LLM opcode stylometry for authorship attribution. Beyond the original JavaScript samples, the dataset includes the following six categories:

- **Simplified Script** – Minimized using `rjsmin`, which removes comments and reduces file size while preserving functionality.  
- **Terser-Parsed and Mangled** – Processed with **Terser**, where “mangling” means renaming variables, functions, and parameters to short, non-descriptive names to reduce size and obfuscate readability.  
- **Obfuscated Version** – Created with the `javascript-obfuscator` npm package to make the code significantly harder to read and reverse-engineer.  
- **Deobfuscated Version** – Generated by applying the `deobfuscator` npm package to reverse the obfuscation and restore code readability.  
- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** – The structural representation of the JavaScript code, useful for program analysis and transformation.  
- **JSIR Representation** – A high-level intermediate representation (IR) that leverages MLIR regions to accurately model control flow structures, used in Google’s JSIR tool for advanced JavaScript analysis.
